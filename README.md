A Software Engineer located in Manchester, UK with plenty of experience working in numerous languages and frameworks.

Due to an unusual journey into engineering, I possess a unique skill set gained in my previous roles from customer service, analytics and various areas of development; this allows me to take an intuitive, creative and analytical approach to my work. Understanding the requirements and urgency from other areas of business and how the requested features, changes or bugs may impact their experience provides me with an advantage when it comes to breaking these down into manageable tickets, refining the tickets to be inf+ormative as possible with visibility of any data to drive the ticket forward and providing a reasonable yet definitive definition of done to ensure we 'hit the nail on the head' when the changes are released.
